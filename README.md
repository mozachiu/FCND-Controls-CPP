# Control of a 3D Quadrotor #

## The Goal of this Project ##

In the real world the flight controller is usually implemented in C or C++. So in this project we will implement your controller in C++. The code you write here can eventually be transferred to a real drone!

You may find it helpful to consult the [Python controller code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls/blob/solution/controller.py) as a reference when you build out this controller in C++.

## Writeup ##
- [README](./README.md) 

## Implemented Controller ##
- [QuadControlParams.txt](config/QuadControlParams.txt): This file contains the configuration for the controller. While the simulator is running, you can modify this file, and the simulator will "refresh" those parameters on the next loop execution.
- [QuadControl.cpp](src/QuadControl.cpp): This is where all the fun is, but I should not say this because this file contains the implementation of the controller only. Most of the time needed to pass the scenarios is spend on the parameter tuning.

Pre:

Let F1, F2, F3, F4 to denote the individual thurst command for the front left, front right, rear left, rear right motors.
Setting the individual motor commands is done based on the input from the controller (i.e., moment command from body rate controller and total thrust command from roll-pitch controller), we can set the individual motor thrust commands. Forces are generated by these four propellers


There are forces generated by propellers - the collective force directed upward is:

The moments are also created by propellers. Roll is produced by the moments from 1st and 3rd propellers conteracted by moments from 2nd and 4th propellers:

alt text

Pitch is produced by the moment from 1st and 2nd propellers mismatch with moments from 3rd and 4th propellers:

Here ùõï is the moment.

The l is a distance between x-axis and propeller location, which is equal to half of the distance between neighboring propellers, and each arm is always at 45¬∞ relative to each axis:

alt text

Yaw is produced by the mismatch between moments from propellers along z-axis by reactive forces.

I did this in the function GenerateMotorCommands() in lines 56 to 85 in QuadControl.cpp.
Implement the body rate controller



### Implemented body rate control in C++. ###
#### The controller should be a proportional controller on body rates to commanded moments. The controller should take into account the moments of inertia of the drone when calculating the commanded moments. ####


I simply converted the body rate controller from python to C++ here, in the function BodyRateControl() in lines 87 to 105 of QuadControl.cpp.


### Implement roll pitch control in C++. ###
#### The controller should use the acceleration and thrust commands, in addition to the vehicle attitude to output a body rate command. The controller should account for the non-linear transformation from local accelerations to body rates. Note that the drone's mass should be accounted for when calculating the target angles. ####

TBD

### Implement altitude controller in C++. ###
#### The controller should use both the down position and the down velocity to command thrust. Ensure that the output value is indeed thrust (the drone's mass needs to be accounted for) and that the thrust includes the non-linear effects from non-zero roll/pitch angles.Additionally, the C++ altitude controller should contain an integrator to handle the weight non-idealities presented in scenario 4. ####

TBD

### Implement lateral position control in C++. ###
#### The controller should use the local NE position and velocity to generate a commanded local acceleration. ####

TBD

### Implement yaw control in C++. ###
#### The controller can be a linear/proportional heading controller to yaw rate commands (non-linear transformation not required). ####

TBD

### Implement calculating the motor commands given commanded thrust and moments in C++. ###
#### The thrust and moments should be converted to the appropriate 4 different desired thrust forces for the moments. Ensure that the dimensions of the drone are properly accounted for when calculating thrust from moments. ####

TBD

## Flight Evaluation ##
#### Your C++ controller is successfully able to fly the provided test trajectory and visually passes inspection of the scenarios leading up to the test trajectory. #####
Ensure that in each scenario the drone looks stable and performs the required task. Specifically check that the student's controller is able to handle the non-linearities of scenario 4 (all three drones in the scenario should be able to perform the required task with the same control gains used).
