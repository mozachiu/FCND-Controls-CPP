# Control of a 3D Quadrotor #

## The Goal of this Project ##

In the real world the flight controller is usually implemented in C or C++. So in this project we will implement your controller in C++. The code you write here can eventually be transferred to a real drone!

You may find it helpful to consult the [Python controller code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls/blob/solution/controller.py) as a reference when you build out this controller in C++.
